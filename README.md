# delivery-request
We have provided some sample code which could be used and modified to send delivery requests to your Zippykind account.  The code provided is meant for demonstration purposes and to give you start on developing an integration into the Zippykind API.

You will need to generate an API key in your Zippykind account.  Follow the instructions on this page https://zippykind.com/docs/documents/create-api-key/ to create an API key.  Once you have generated an API key, edit the file send-order-to-zippykind.php by replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.
